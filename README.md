# Vehicle_Number_Plate_Detection
With the increase in the number of vehicles and the deployment of traffic monitoring cameras, license plate identification has become a topic of great interest. License plate recognition helps to identify vehicles and assists in vehicle tracking and activities analysis for surveillance and security purposes. As the demand for traffic management and safe vehicle monitoring systems continues to grow, vehicle handling has become a potential research challenge. 

Relevant Solution By This Project: 

To solve such kind of set of critical problem, I have made a proper digital and organized and efficient technical procedure, 
Step 1 : Initially using quadcopter(drone) & camera we capture real time video/image.
Step 2 : After Capturing, we will execute Tree based Machine Learning Algorithm to detect Vehicle Number Plate.
Step 3: Now, we will sign-up/log-in through credential portal.
Step 4: After that We will fetch registered vehicle registered details from the server.
Step 5: Therefore We can Perform Vehicle Tracking, Permission to authorized vehicle & Payment for Parking Fee, Detection of Vehicle Over-Speed Limits, Reducing Road Accidents, Make the System Safe, Secure, Fast, and Organized etc based applications.
